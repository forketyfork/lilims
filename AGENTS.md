# Coding Agent Guidelines

This repository may be edited by automated coding agents. Please follow these rules when contributing automatically generated changes:

1. Keep Swift code formatted with Xcode defaults (4-space indentation).
2. Keep Python scripts compatible with Python 3.10.
3. Place new documentation under `Docs/` and keep README up to date if the project structure changes.
4. When adding Swift files, include minimal DocC comments for public APIs.
5. Run `swift test` before committing if unit tests are added in the future.
