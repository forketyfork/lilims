#  Lilims

Lilims is an iOS application project focused on running small language models entirely on device. The app can download, convert and execute LLMs using Core ML or llama.cpp backends. The repository now contains a minimal Swift Package that builds an iOS app using Swift 6.0.

```
Scripts/        Python helpers for model conversion and quantization (Python 3.13)
Sources/        Swift code for the app and runtime libraries
    Runtime/
        CoreML/   Core ML pipeline and model management
        LlamaCpp/ Interface to the llama.cpp backend
        Tokenizer/Swift tokenizer utilities
    UI/          SwiftUI-based user interface
Tests/          Unit tests for app functionality
BenchmarkKit/   Integration performance tests
Docs/           Additional documentation
*.xcworkspace   Xcode workspace referencing the Swift package
```

The goal is to experiment with on-device LLM inference and benchmarking on Apple silicon. The runtime uses Swift 6.0 and the scripts require Python 3.13. Continuous integration builds the iOS target and runs the Swift and Python tests on each pull request. The iOS workflow installs SwiftÂ 6.1 using [`swift-actions/setup-swift`](https://github.com/swift-actions/setup-swift) and invokes `xcodebuild` with `-toolchain "$TOOLCHAINS"` so the correct toolchain is used.
Python scripts are linted with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) and tested using `pytest`.


## Development Environment

The project includes a Nix flake that provides a reproducible development environment with Python dependencies and development utilities. **Note:** This setup uses your system Swift toolchain and Xcode instead of Nix-provided Swift packages to ensure compatibility with Swift 6.0 and modern macOS SDKs.

**Prerequisites:**
- Xcode installed and properly configured (`xcode-select --install`)
- System Swift 6.0+ available

```bash
# Install Nix (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install

# Install direnv (if not already installed)
nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv

# Enable direnv in your shell (add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"  # for bash
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"   # for zsh

# Clone and enter the project directory
cd lilims
direnv allow
```

The Nix environment provides:
- Python 3.13 with numpy, pytest, and ruff
- Development utilities: ripgrep (rg), fd, tree, gh, just
- System Swift toolchain integration (uses your installed Xcode/Swift)
- Common development tasks via `just` command runner

## Common Tasks

The project uses [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner for common development tasks:

```bash
just clean    # Clean build artifacts
just build    # Build the project using system Swift
just test     # Run all tests (Swift via system toolchain + Python)
just lint     # Run linting (Python via ruff + Swift tests)
```
